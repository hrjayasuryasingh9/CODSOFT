# Task-01: Landing Page

## Description

This project is a responsive landing page created as Task-01 from Level-1 for my internship at CodSoft. A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills, encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the page.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.
- **Bootstrap**: Used to ensure responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive, making it accessible and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu changes color or style based on user interaction (scrolling or hovering).
- **Fixed Navigation**: The navigation menu is fixed and remains visible as the user scrolls through the page.
